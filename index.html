            Not tryna be indie
            Not tryna be cool
            Just tryna be in this
            Tell me, are you too?
            Can you feel where the wind is?
            Can you feel it through
            All of the windows
            Inside this room?
            
            'Cause I wanna touch you baby
            And I wanna feel you too
            I wanna see the sun rise
            On your sins just me and you
            
            [Zayn and Sia:]

            Baby, I am right here
            
            But you'll never be alone
            I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
            I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
            Baby, I am right here
            I'll hold you when things go wrong

            Your life in the daytime is over. There's eyes on you everywhere. You know that, right? I'm watching you. My crew's watching you. You know your little homies? They pissed off. They mad at you, bro. Your name is mud on the streets. Oh, I know who you are.
            [Zayn:]
            You don't know me.
